### How to Populate data

Due to vulnerabilities, my API key has been hidden and instead is viewed as api_key=[YOUR_API_KEY]. In order to populate the app with data please register for your own personal API Key at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction. Please sign up for TheMovieDb in order to receive their API Key. The developers at TheMovieDb have also included a well put-together list of documents to help with setting up with their API.
